# moPepGen: <u>M</u>ulti-<u>O</u>mics <u>Pep</u>tide <u>Gen</u>erator

moPepGen (multi-omics peptide generator) uses data from multiple-omics experiments and calls variant peptides as custom databases for proteogenomic library search.

moPepGen takes genomic variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNP or SNV), insertion/deletion (INDEL), gene fusion, and post-transcriptional modifications such as RNA editing and alternative splicing, and detects variated peptides affected.
