## Reference

Reference data, incluiding reference genome, genome annotation, and protein coding translation are required. There are two ways of specifying reference data:

1. Using the index dir created by the [`generateIndex`](/generate-index) command.
2. Specifying each reference files needed.

1 is highly recommended as it is faster and helps you ensure that the same reference data are used across the project.
